Group_Project_1
by **manDown**

In this group project we set out to complete a few tasks.
**1)** Find some things we can make and eat.
**2)** Find some places to eat things we can't make.
**We accomplished both.**

On our page, you can press the dine in button to pick some ingredients you would like to include or exclude, and make a meal.
This uses the _Edamam_ API.
Or Edamam ajax will pull 10 responses to your query and populate two different html rows with the results and ingredients.

If instead you would like to go out and eat something, we added options to pickup something instead.
This uses the _Zomato_ API.
Our Zomato Ajax will find restaraunts in your area that match your desired food type.
